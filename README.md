# DCM: A Mathematica package for simulation of random walks in Directed Configuration Model

A Mathematica implementation of the [directed configuration
model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Configuration_model#Directed_configuration_model). See
`test.nb` for how to use the package `DCM.wl`.

For the simulation regarding the [maximum stationary value](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07246) and
[PageRank](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04993) in DCM, see `heavey-tail-degree-dist-simulation.nb`.
